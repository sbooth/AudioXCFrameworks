Generating patches
------------------

First ensure you have an up-to-date checkout of the git repository.
liboggz is maintained in git at git://git.xiph.org/liboggz.git

Please generate patches using git-format-patch. You'll just need to commit
your changes to your local copy first:

$ git commit -a

then do:

$ git format-patch -1

which will generate a patch file with your attribution as the committer
name and your own commit message. That file can then be applied to another
(eg. upstream) git tree using "git am" to preserve that info.

Mail that file directly or as an attachment to ogg-dev@xiph.org.
