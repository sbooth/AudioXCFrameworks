 * and <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Vorbis</a>.
 * Oggz is also compatible with 
 * <a href="http://www.annodex.net/">Annodex</a> streams, and supports seeking
 * on all tracks described in an
 * <a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/OggSkeleton">Ogg Skeleton</a> track.
 *
 * You need to open the file with the OGGZ_AUTO flag set:
 *
 * - Create an OGGZ handle for reading with \a flags = OGGZ_READ | OGGZ_AUTO
 * - Read data, ensuring that you have received all b_o_s pages before
 *   attempting to seek.
 *
 * Oggz will silently parse known codec headers and associate metrics
 * appropriately; if you attempt to seek before you have received all
 * b_o_s pages, Oggz will not have had a chance to parse the codec headers
 * and associate metrics.
 * It is safe to seek once you have received a packet with \a b_o_s == 0;
 * see the \link basics Ogg basics \endlink section for more details.
 *
 * \note Oggz parses these codec headers internally, and so liboggz is \b not
 * linked to libspeex, libvorbis, libflac, libtheora, libcmml or libannodex.
 *
 * For other data streams, you will need to provide a metric function;

 * \section seek_semantics_intro Introduction
 *
 *         [*** This line works around a bug in doxygen ***]
 *
 *         [*** This line works around a bug in doxygen ***]
 *
 * The seeking semantics of the Ogg file format were outlined by Monty in
 * <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031201054855/http://www.xiph.org/archives/theora-dev/200209/0040.html"> a 
 * post to theora-dev</a> in September 2002. Quoting from that post, we
 * have the following assumptions:
 *
 * - Ogg is not a non-linear format. ... It is a media transport format
 *   designed to do nothing more than deliver content, in a stream, and
 *   have all the pieces arrive on time and in sync.
 * - The Ogg layer does not know the specifics of the codec data it's
 *   multiplexing into a stream. It knows nothing beyond 'Oooo, packets!',
 *   that the packets belong to different buckets, that the packets go in
 *   order, and that packets have position markers. Ogg does not even have
 *   a concept of 'time'; it only knows about the sequentially increasing,
 *   unitless position markers. It is up to higher layers which have
 *   access to the codec APIs to assign and convert units of framing or
 *   time.
 *
 * (For more details on the structure of Ogg streams, see the
 * \link basics Ogg Basics \endlink section).
 *
 * For data such as media, for which it is possible to provide a mapping
 * such as 'time', Oggz can efficiently navigate through an Ogg stream
 * by use of an OggzMetric callback, thus allowing automatic seeking to
 * points in 'time'.
 *
 * For common codecs you can ask Oggz to set this for you automatically by
 * instantiating the OGGZ handle with the OGGZ_AUTO flag set. For others
 * you can specify a multiplier with oggz_set_metric_linear(), or a generic
 * non-linear metric with oggz_set_metric().
 *
 */

/** \defgroup metric Using OggzMetric
 *
 * \section metric_intro Introduction
 *
 * An OggzMetric is a helper function for Oggz's seeking mechanism.
 *
 * If every position in an Ogg stream can be described by a metric such as
 * time, then it is possible to define a function that, given a serialno and
 * granulepos, returns a measurement in units such as milliseconds. Oggz
 * will use this function repeatedly while seeking in order to navigate
 * through the Ogg stream.
 *
 * The meaning of the units is arbitrary, but must be consistent across all
 * logical bitstreams. This allows Oggz to seek accurately through Ogg
 * bitstreams containing multiple logical bitstreams such as tracks of media.
 *
 * \section setting How to set metrics
 *
 * You don't need to set metrics for Speex, Vorbis, FLAC, Theora, CMML or
 * Annodex.
 * These can be handled \link seek_api automatically \endlink by Oggz.
 *
 * For most others it is simply a matter of providing a "granulerate":
 * a frame or sampling rate, if each packet's granulepos represents a
 * sample number.
 *
 * - Set the \a granule_rate_numerator and \a granule_rate_denominator
 *   appropriately using oggz_set_granulerate()
 *
 * Some codecs use a "granuleshift" to divide a granulepos into two halves;
 * the first describing a dependency on a previous packet, the second
 * giving the offset since that packet. This is used to mark keyframes and
 * intermediate frames.
 *
 * - Set the \a granuleshift appropriately using oggz_set_granuleshift()
 *
 * \subsection custom Custom Metrics
 *
 * For streams with non-linear granulepos, you need to set a custom metric:
 *
 * - Implement an OggzMetric callback
 * - Set the OggzMetric callback using oggz_set_metric()
 *
 * \section using Seeking with OggzMetrics
 *
 * To seek, use oggz_seek_units(). Oggz will perform a ratio search
 * through the Ogg bitstream, using the OggzMetric callback to determine
 * its position relative to the desired unit.
 *
 * \note
 *
 * Many data streams begin with headers describing such things as codec
 * setup parameters. One of the assumptions Monty makes is:
 *
 * - Given pre-cached decode headers, a player may seek into a stream at
 *   any point and begin decode.
 *
 * Thus, the first action taken by applications dealing with such data is
 * to read in and cache the decode headers; thereafter the application can
 * safely seek to arbitrary points in the data.
 *
 * This impacts seeking because the portion of the bitstream containing
 * decode headers should not be considered part of the metric space. To
 * inform Oggz not to seek earlier than the end of the decode headers,
 * use oggz_set_data_start().

 *
 * - A mechanism to aid seeking across non-metric spaces for which a partial
 *   order exists (ie. data that is not synchronised by a measure such as time,
 *   but is nevertheless somehow seekably structured), is also planned.
 *
 * \subsection OggzOrder
 *
 * Suppose there is a partial order < and a corresponding equivalence
 * relation = defined on the space of packets in the Ogg stream of 'OGGZ'.
 * An OggzOrder simply provides a comparison in terms of '<' and '=' for
 * ogg_packets against a target.
 *
 * To use OggzOrder:
 *
 * - Implement an OggzOrder callback
 * - Set the OggzOrder callback for an OGGZ handle with oggz_set_order()
 * - To seek, use oggz_seek_byorder(). Oggz will use a combination bisection
 *   search and scan of the Ogg bitstream, using the OggzOrder callback to
 *   match against the desired 'target'.
 *
 * Otherwise, for more general ogg streams for which a partial order can be
 * defined, define a function matching this specification.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *     OGGZ: the OGGZ object
 *     op:  an ogg packet in the stream
 *     target: a user defined object
 *
 * Return values:
 *
 *    -1 , if 'op' would occur before the position represented by 'target'
 *     0 , if the position of 'op' is equivalent to that of 'target'
 *     1 , if 'op' would occur after the position represented by 'target'
 *     2 , if the relationship between 'op' and 'target' is undefined.
 *
 * Symbolically:
 *
 * Suppose there is a partial order < and a corresponding equivalence
 * relation = defined on the space of packets in the Ogg stream of 'OGGZ'.
 * Let p represent the position of the packet 'op', and t be the position
 * represented by 'target'.
 *
 * Then a function implementing OggzPacketOrder should return as follows:
 *
 *    -1 , p < t
 *     0 , p = t
 *     1 , t < p
 *     2 , otherwise
 *
 * Hacker's hint: if there are no circumstances in which you would return
 * a value of 2, there is a linear order; it may be possible to define a
 * Metric rather than an Order.
