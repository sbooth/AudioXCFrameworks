Oggz 1.0.0 Release
------------------

Oggz comprises liboggz and the tool oggz, which provides commands to
inspect, edit and validate Ogg files. The oggz-chop tool can also be
used to serve time ranges of Ogg media over HTTP by any web server that
supports CGI.

liboggz is a C library for reading and writing Ogg files and streams.
It offers various features over the reference libogg, including
support for seeking, validation and timestamp interpretation. Ogg is
an interleaving data container developed by Monty at Xiph.org,
originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio format but now used for
many free codecs including Dirac, FLAC, Speex and Theora.

New in this release
===================

This is a stable maintenance release including the result of many months of
security review and bug fixes included in the Mozilla Firefox 3.5 release.
It is API and ABI backwards-compatible with all liboggz releases since 0.8.0
(released Dec 18 2003).

It includes build fixes and updates for embedded platforms including ARM
and SH4, and updated Visual Studio project files for Microsoft Windows
native builds. The default build environment uses GCC with GNU autotools.

This release includes a new "oggz codecs" command, which simply lists the
codecs present in one or more files. The default comma-separated output
is designed for use in an HTML5 <video> codecs attribute.


Details
=======

Build
-----

	* Updated Visual Studio project files (Barry Duncan)
	* configure.ac: fix for arm, sh4 builds
	* remove DocBook .sgml files, use .1 directly
	* Debian #540360: use version script on GNU/kFreeBSD

oggz tools
----------

	* oggz-chop: fix detection of accumulated continued pages, ie. when
          all accumulated pages have granulepos -1 and thus should all be
          kept when advancing the accumulator
	* oggz-chop: add a page accumulator for plain pages. Accumulate pages
          even for start=0, or tracks with no granuleshift, for cases where
          continued pages occur at the chop time.

	* oggz-codecs: New tool

	* oggz-comment: Handle duplicate comments, with unit test

Documentation
-------------

	* add oggz.1 man page
	* add examples to chop, comment, dump, info, merge, rip and sort
	  man pages
	* update ChangeLog with info from all release_notes
	* Add PATCHES file, update README

Public API
----------

	* Add ability to limit seeks to only search inside a specified byte
	  range. Adds oggz_bounded_seek_set() public API call.

	* Updated shared version info to 7:0:6

Internal
--------

	* Handle Theora version > 3.2.0 initial granulepos 1|0

	* Fix data alignment on ARM (Erik de Castro Lopo, Chris Double,
	  Vladimir Vukicevic)

	* Fix for inefficient oggz_seek_units() (Sean Young)

	* oggz_read: always set the internal offset to the start of the
	  current page. This is returned by oggz_tell() and can be queried
	  within a ReadPage callback.
	* oggz_read: Fix packetno check for holes in headers. The packetno
	  has not yet been incremented, so the value to check is off-by-one.

	* Annodex #1581: avoid _oggz_comment_add_byname() strcmp of NULL
	  (keelerda)
	* Mozilla #499604, Annodex #486: avoid uninitialized variable in
	  oggz_seek_end()
	* Mozilla #506870: fix leaks in oggz-comments.c
	* Mozilla #506878: check oggz_stream_get_content() return values
	* Mozilla #515376: Check index in dirac_parse_info()


About Oggz
==========

oggz tool
---------

Usage: oggz <subcommand> [options] filename ...

oggz is a commandline tool for manipulating Ogg files. It supports
multiplexed files conformant with RFC3533. Oggz can parse headers for
CELT, CMML, FLAC, Kate, PCM, Speex, Theora and Vorbis, and can read and write
Ogg Skeleton logical bitstreams.

Commands:
  help          Display help for a specific subcommand (eg. "oggz help chop")

Reporting:
  codecs        Display the list of codecs found in one or more files and
                their bitstreams.
  diff          Hexdump the packets of two Ogg files and output differences.
  dump          Hexdump packets of an Ogg file, or revert an Ogg file from
                such a hexdump.
  info          Display information about one or more Ogg files and their
                bitstreams.
  scan          Scan an Ogg file and output characteristic landmarks.
  validate      Validate the Ogg framing of one or more files.

Extraction:
  rip           Extract one or more logical bitstreams from an Ogg file.

Editing:
  chop          Extract the part of an Ogg file between given start and/or
                end times.
  comment       List or edit comments in an Ogg file.
  merge         Merge Ogg files together, interleaving pages in order of
                presentation time.
  sort          Sort the pages of an Ogg file in order of presentation time.

Miscellaneous:
  known-codecs  List codecs known by this version of oggz


The script bash-completion/oggz enables completion of tool options and codec
names when using the bash shell. Source it from your .profile, or install it
in /etc/bash_completion.d to enable it system-wide.


liboggz
-------

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while
presenting the following API niceties:

        * Full API documentation

        * Comprehensive test suite of read, write and seeking behavior.
        The entire test suite can be run under valgrind if available.

        * Developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX, Win32 and
        Symbian OS. May work on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
        For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files
        and Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are provided in the source
        distribution.

        * Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg bitstreams,
        to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated; writes can fail
        if you try to write illegally structured packets.

        * A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close
        interface to raw Ogg files.

        * Writing automatically interleaves with packet queuing, and provides
        callback based notification when this queue is empty

        * A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg
        data. Seeking works easily and reliably on multitrack and multi-codec
        streams, and can transparently parse Theora, Speex, Vorbis, FLAC,
        CMML, CELT and Ogg Skeleton headers without requiring linking to those
        libraries. This allows efficient use on servers and other devices
        that need to parse and seek within Ogg files, but do not need to do
        a full media decode.
