Oggz 0.9.2 Release
------------------

Oggz comprises liboggz and the command-line tools oggzinfo, oggzdump,
oggzdiff, oggzmerge, oggzrip and oggz-validate.

liboggz is a C library providing a simple programming interface for reading
and writing Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container
developed by Monty at Xiph.Org, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio
format.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

http://www.annodex.net/software/liboggz/download/liboggz-0.9.2.tar.gz

New in this release:

	* New and improved examples:

	rewrite-pages: example code stub to build tools from
	fix-eos: new example tool to fix missing EOS flags (MikeS)

	* Build system improvements (thomasvs)

	* Bugfixes / closed tickets:

	oggzinfo: Fix calculation of content duration. (ticket:117)
	oggzmerge: Fix an interleaving error in oggzmerge. (ticket:121)
	oggzrip: fix memory corruption detected by glibc on Fedora Core
	         (reported/fixed by thomasvs)
	oggz-validate: report streams with missing *** eos (ticket:146)
	oggz-validate: report and fail on non-Ogg files (ticket:147)

	* Removed need for ./configure --disable-shared when running tests
	under valgrind

Special thanks to Fluendo (http://www.fluendo.com/) for their contributions
to this release, and for their compassion and forebearance in indulging the
peculiarities of Ogg.

 
About Oggz
----------

Oggz comprises liboggz and the command-line tools oggzinfo, oggzdump,
oggzdiff, oggzmerge, oggzrip and oggz-validate.

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while
presenting the following API niceties:

	* Full API documentation

	* Comprehensive test suite of read, write and seeking behavior.
        The entire test suite can be run under valgrind if available.

	* Developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX, Win32 and
	Symbian OS. May work on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
	For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files
	and Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are provided in the source
	distribution.

	* Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg bitstreams,
	to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated; writes can fail
	if you try to write illegally structured packets.

	* A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close
	interface to raw Ogg files.

	* Writing automatically interleaves with packet queuing, and provides	
	callback based notification when this queue is empty

	* A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg
	data. Seeking works easily and reliably on multitrack and multi-codec
	streams, and can transparently parse Theora, Speex, Vorbis, FLAC,
	CMML and Ogg Skeleton headers  without requiring linking to those
	libraries. This allows efficient use on servers and other devices
	that need to parse and seek within Ogg files, but do not need to do
	a full media decode.

Full documentation of the liboggz API, customization and installation,
and mux and demux examples can be read online at:

Tools
-----

The Oggz source tarball also contains the following command-line tools,
which are useful for debugging and testing Ogg bitstreams:

        * oggzinfo: Display information about one or more Ogg files and
        their bitstreams.

	* oggzdump: Hexdump packets of an Ogg file, or revert an Ogg file
	from such a hexdump.

	* oggzdiff: Hexdump the packets of two Ogg files and output
	differences.

	* oggzmerge: Merge Ogg files together, interleaving pages in order
	of presentation time.

	* oggzrip: Extract one or more logical bitstreams from an Ogg file.

        * oggz-validate: Validate the Ogg framing of one or more files.
