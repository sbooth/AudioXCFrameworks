Oggz 0.9.0 Release
------------------

liboggz is a C library providing a simple programming interface for reading
and writing Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container
developed by Monty at Xiph.Org, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio
format.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

http://www.annodex.net/software/liboggz/download/liboggz-0.9.0.tar.gz

New in this release:

	* updates for keyframe seeking in Theora and files with Ogg Skeleton
	metaheaders (http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/OggSkeleton)
	* added missing header file definitions for oggz_get_granulerate()
	and oggz_get_granuleshift()
	* build fix for Symbian, adding missing file oggz_seek.c (Colin Ward)
	* general code cleanups
	* updated libtool shared version info to 2:0:1

Also, an addendum to the release notes for the previous version 0.8.6:

	Applied patch from Erik de Castro Lopo. Now builds on MingGW:
        * add pkg-config check for Ogg
        * add vorbis and speex CFLAGS to various Makefile.am's

About Oggz
----------

Oggz comprises liboggz and the command-line tools oggzdump, oggzdiff,
oggzmerge and oggzrip.

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while
presenting the following API niceties:

	* Full API documentation

	* Comprehensive test suite of read, write and seeking behavior.

	* Developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX, Win32 and
	Symbian OS. May work on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
	For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files
	and Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are provided in the source
	distribution.

	* Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg bitstreams,
	to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated; writes can fail
	if you try to write illegally structured packets.

	* A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close
	interface to raw Ogg files.

	* Writing automatically interleaves with packet queuing, and provides	
	callback based notification when this queue is empty

	* A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg
	data. Seeking works easily and reliably on multitrack and multi-codec
	streams, and can transparently parse Theora, Speex, Vorbis, FLAC,
	CMML and Ogg Skeleton headers  without requiring linking to those
	libraries. This allows efficient use on servers and other devices
	that need to parse and seek within Ogg files, but do not need to do
	a full media decode.

Full documentation of the liboggz API, customization and installation,
and mux and demux examples can be read online at:

Tools
-----

The Oggz source tarball also contains the following command-line tools,
which are useful for debugging and testing Ogg bitstreams:

	* oggzdump: Hexdump packets of an Ogg file, or revert an Ogg file
	from such a hexdump.

	* oggzdiff: Hexdump the packets of two Ogg files and output
	differences Oggz is Free Software, available under a BSD-style
	license.

	* oggzmerge: Merge Ogg files together, interleaving pages in order
	of presentation time.

	* oggzrip: Extract one or more logical bitstreams from an Ogg file.
