Oggz 0.8.6 Release
------------------

liboggz is a C library providing a simple programming interface for reading
and writing Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container
developed by Monty at Xiph.Org, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio
format.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

http://www.annodex.net/software/liboggz/download/liboggz-0.8.6.tar.gz

New in this release:

	* new oggzrip tool, for ripping individual tracks from Ogg files;
	by David Kuehling
	* added inbuilt parsing of FLAC headers for seeking hints, by
	Tobias Gehrig. This allows Ogg FLAC files to be used with oggzmerge
	and similar tools.
	* fixed oggzmerge binary open bug on Win32 (Colin Ward)
	* updated Win32 project by Orum
	* added inbuilt parsing of Ogg Skeleton and CMML binary headers
	* simplified documentation related to seeking
	* added oggz_{get,set}_{granulerate,granuleshift}() query functions

About Oggz
----------

Oggz comprises liboggz and the command-line tools oggzdump, oggzdiff,
oggzmerge and oggzrip.

liboggz supports the flexibility afforded by the Ogg file format while
presenting the following API niceties:

	* Full API documentation.

	* Comprehensive test suite of read, write and seeking behavior.

	* Developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX, Win32 and
	Symbian OS. May work on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
	For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files
	and Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are provided in the source
	distribution.

	* Strict adherence to the formatting requirements of Ogg bitstreams,
	to ensure that only valid bitstreams are generated; writes can fail
	if you try to write illegally structured packets.

	* A simple, callback based open/read/close or open/write/close
	interface to raw Ogg files.

	* Writing automatically interleaves with packet queuing, and provides	
	callback based notification when this queue is empty

	* A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg
	data. Seeking works easily and reliably on multitrack and multi-codec
	streams, and can transparently parse Theora, Speex, Vorbis, FLAC and
	CMML headers  without requiring linking to those libraries. This
	allows efficient use on servers and other devices that need to parse
	and seek within Ogg files, but do not need to do a full media decode.

Full documentation of the liboggz API, customization and installation,
and mux and demux examples can be read online at:

Tools
-----

The Oggz source tarball also contains the following command-line tools,
which are useful for debugging and testing Ogg bitstreams:

	* oggzdump: Hexdump packets of an Ogg file, or revert an Ogg file
	from such a hexdump.

	* oggzdiff: Hexdump the packets of two Ogg files and output
	differences Oggz is Free Software, available under a BSD-style
	license.

	* oggzmerge: Merge Ogg files together, interleaving pages in order
	of presentation time.

	* oggzrip: Extract one or more logical bitstreams from an Ogg file.
