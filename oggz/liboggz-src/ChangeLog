Thu Oct  8 16:48:47 JST 2009 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 1.1.0

	This release introduces a new API structure for reporting the byte
	offsets of the start and end pages for each packet.

	Public API:
	* Added <oggz/oggz_packet.h>: add oggz_packet definition, and
	  implement reader to return oggz_packet in OggzReadPacket callback.

	frames, which are produced by the recently-released libtheora-1.1 encoder.

	Public API:
	* Updated shared version info to 7:1:6

	Internal:
	* Mozilla #516847 - calc gp for duplicate frames
	  Theora encodes duplicate frames as zero-length packets, so

Tue Sep 15 07:27:18 JST 2009 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 1.0.0

	This is a stable maintenance release, including build fixes and
	updates for embedded platforms (ARM, SH4) and updated Visual Studio
	project files for Microsoft Windows.

	This release also includes a new "oggz codecs" command, which simply
	lists the codecs present in one or more files. The default
	comma-separated output is designed for use in an HTML5 <video> codecs
	attribute.

	Build:
	* Updated Visual Studio project files (Barry Duncan)
	* configure.ac: fix for arm, sh4 builds
	* remove DocBook .sgml files, use .1 directly
	* Debian #540360: use version script on GNU/kFreeBSD

	oggz tools:
	* oggz-chop: fix detection of accumulated continued pages, ie. when
	  all accumulated pages have granulepos -1 and thus should all be
	  kept when advancing the accumulator
	* oggz-chop: add a page accumulator for plain pages. Accumulate pages
	  even for start=0, or tracks with no granuleshift, for cases where
	  continued pages occur at the chop time.
	* oggz-codecs: New tool
	* oggz-comment: Handle duplicate comments, with unit test

	Documentation:
	* add oggz.1 man page

	  Vladimir Vukicevic)
	* Fix for inefficient oggz_seek_units() (Sean Young)
	* oggz_read: always set the internal offset to the start of the
	  current page. This is returned by oggz_tell() and can be queried
	  within a ReadPage callback.
	* oggz_read: Fix packetno check for holes in headers. The packetno
	  has not yet been incremented, so the value to check is off-by-one.
	* Annodex #1581: avoid _oggz_comment_add_byname() strcmp of NULL
	  (keelerda)
	* Mozilla #499604, Annodex #486: avoid uninitialized variable in

Fri Feb 15 16:52:21 JST 2008 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 0.9.7

	  This release adds a new oggz-sort tool, includes fixes for serialno
	  generation on 64bit (LP64) platforms, and adds decoding of FLAC
	  vorbiscomment packets and basic support for the Ogg mapping of the
	  experimental CELT codec. It also includes various API additions,

	  which modifies Ogg header packets but leaves data pages intact.

	liboggz API:
	* Added oggz_comments_copy().

	* Updated acinclude.m4 to latest ogg.m4. (Ivo Gonçalves)
	* Added basic support for (experimental) Ogg mapping for CELT codec.
	* libtool shared version info updated to 5:0:4


Sun Jan 13 13:27:57 JST 2008

	* Version 0.9.6

	  This release adds a new oggz-comment tool, and improvements to
	  liboggz's determination of timestamps and seeking. Specifically,
	  liboggz now inspects the encoded data in order reconstruct the
	  expected granulepos (corresponding to a timestamp) for every packet
	  in an Ogg stream. This allows applications to use reliable
	  timestamps, even though these are only sparsely recorded in most
	  Ogg streams.

	Tools:
	* Added new oggz-comment tool (Kangyuan Niu)
	* Added Skeleton support to oggzinfo (Tahseen Mohammad)
	* Report FLAC samplerate, channels in oggzinfo (Conrad Parker)

	Documentation:
	* Improved oggzmerge documentation (Debian bug #280550)

	  oggz_stream_get_content(), oggz_stream_get_content_type()
	  (Shane Stephens)
	* Added oggz_tell_granulepos function to query liboggz for
	  granulepos values. (Shane Stephens)

	  in Ogg Vorbis, Speex, Theora, FLAC files (Conrad Parker, Ian Malone)
	* Added oggz_get_numtracks() (Conrad Parker)

	Internal:
	* Added automatic calculation of missing granulepos values
	  in Vorbis, Speex, Theora (Shane Stephens) and FLAC (Conrad Parker)
	* Seeking improvements (Shane Stephens)
	* Corrections for C standards support (Erik de Castro Lopo)
	* GNU Autotools build system updates (Ralph Giles, Thomas van der
	  Stichele)
	* Updated Win32 build system (Alex Krumm-Heller, Marcin Lubonski)
	* libtool shared version info updated to 4:0:3

2007-01-12  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* Makefile.am:
	  dist uninstalled pc file
	* oggz-uninstalled.pc.in:
	  added
	* configure.ac:
	  increase package version so liboggplay can require > 0.9.5


Mon Mar 13 14:58:23 EST 2006 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 0.9.5

	* Fixed and updated Windows (Visual Studio) support
	  - added missing exported symbols, projects for oggz tools.
	  (Alex Krumm-Heller, Silvia Pfeiffer)

	* Support for OggPCM (Draft 2, Main header)

	  OggPCM is an experimental specification for storing uncompressed
	  PCM audio in Ogg bitstreams.

	  - liboggz: Recognition of OggPCM timestamps, and support for
	  seeking in files that contain OggPCM logical bitstreams.
	  - oggzinfo: Display OggPCM header details
	  - oggzdump, oggzrip: New [--content-type pcm, -c pcm] option
	  to filter on OggPCM
	  - oggz-validate: Validate framing of OggPCM logical bitstreams

	  This version is installed on http://validator.annodex.org/ for
	  online validation of OggPCM files.

	  For more information about OggPCM, see:
	    http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/OggPCM

	* ./configure support for large (>2GB) files
	  This version adds build configuration support for large files,
	  allowing liboggz to operate on files >2GB. This version does
	  not introduce any API changes; interfaces such as oggz_tell()
	  continue to use off_t externally. However, sequential reading
	  and validation of large files is now possible.

	* bug fixes and cleanups:
	  - oggz-validate, oggzmerge, oggzdump, oggz-scan, oggzinfo: handle
	  unknown content types (Ian Malone)
	  - remove deprecated oggzed example
	  - various code and documentation build cleanups


Tue Feb 14 10:14:09 EST 2006 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 0.9.4

	* liboggz: Added new oggz_run() convenience function
	  - equivalent to calling oggz_read() or oggz_write() in a loop,
	  but only returns upon completion or error
	  - added new oggz_run_set_blocksize() function
	  - updated libtool shared version info to 3:0:2

	* liboggz: Improved callback handling
	  - added delayed callback error handling for oggz_read*() and
	  oggz_write*() functions. When a reading or writing operation is
	  stopped by a user callback returning OGGZ_STOP_OK or OGGZ_STOP_ERR,
	  that return value is cached and reported by the subsequent call
	  to oggz_read*() or oggz_write*() (unless no data has been read or
	  written, in which case it is reported immediately as before). This
	  ensures that a user callback returning OGGZ_STOP_OK or
	  OGGZ_STOP_ERR is always explicitly acknowledged without requiring
	  the application to track its own errors.

	* Improvements to oggz-validate:
	  - added ability to run oggz-validate on stdin, using "-" as filename
	  - added --prefix, --suffix and --partial options to suppress errors
	  when only validating the specified portion of a complete stream
	  - add --max-errors num option to specify the maximum number of
	  errors to bail out after, or 0 to show all errors (ticket:154)
	  - if an input file fails oggz_open(), continue processing other
	  files on the commandline rather than exiting immediately
	  - improved documentation of errors detected by oggz-validate
	  - added --help-errors (-E) option to just list known errors,
	  without other help text around

	* oggzmerge: When merging Vorbis and Theora streams, ensure the
	  Theora header appears first in the output file in conformance with
	  the Ogg Theora bitstream specification. (ticket:189)

2005-11-17  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* configure.ac:
	* doc/Makefile.am:
	  Work also with docbook2man as installed on Fedora

Fri Oct 7 16:59:32 EST 2005 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 0.9.3
	* New oggz-scan tool (silvia)
	  oggz-scan displays timestamps of characteristic features in an Ogg
	  file. 'oggz-scan --keyframes file.ogg' displays timestamps of
	  unforced Theora keyframes, which are a useful rough approximation of
	  shot boundaries. Results can be output as plain text, CMML or HTML.
	* Improvements to oggz-validate:
	  - added page-level validation, ensuring that a page that ends zero
	  packets has the correct granulepos, -1. (MikeS)
	  - added a check that any Theora bos pages come before Vorbis and
	  Speex bos pages. (ticket:156) (conrad)
	  - correct handling of chained files (ticket: 162) (conrad)
	* win32 build fix for oggz tools (j^)
	* liboggz: replace internal typedef of oggz_off_t, use off_t instead
	  of long (ticket:161) (Grayfox)
	* examples/fix-eos: discard trailing incomplete packets from the end
	  of the stream. (MikeS)
	* remove autogenerated manpages (ticket:155) (conrad, silvia)

Mon Jul 11 22:14:14 CST 2005 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 0.9.2
	* added rewrite-pages example code stub to build tools from
	* added fix-eos example tool to fix missing EOS flags (MikeS)
	* Build system improvements (thomasvs)
	* oggzinfo: Fix calculation of content duration. (ticket:117)
	* oggzmerge: Fix an interleaving error in oggzmerge. (ticket:121)
	* oggzrip: fix memory corruption detected by glibc on Fedora Core
	           (reported/fixed by thomasvs)
	* oggz-validate: report streams with missing *** eos (ticket:146)
	* oggz-validate: report and fail on non-Ogg files (ticket:147)
	* Removed need for ./configure --disable-shared when running tests
	under valgrind

2005-06-13  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* autogen.sh:
	* m4/as-ac-expand.m4:
	  add m4 dir and use it
	  add an expand macro
	* configure.ac:
	  uniformize configure's output across the annodex stack

2005-06-13  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* doc/Makefile.am:
	  the doxygen stamp file is a build marker and should not be installed

2005-06-09  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* src/tools/oggz-basetime.c: (filter_page), (read_page):
	  Don't adjust granulepos of the three header packets' pages

2005-06-07  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* src/tools/oggzrip.c:
	  fixes memory corruption detected by glibc on Fedora Core

2005-06-07  Thomas Vander Stichele  <thomas at apestaart dot org>

	* include/oggz/Makefile.am:
	  don't override includedir

Fri Apr 8 23:52:31 EST 2005 Conrad Parker <conrad@metadecks.org>

	* Version 0.9.1
	* Added new oggzinfo tool
	* Added new oggz-validate tool
	* oggzdump now displays packet lengths (in bytes, kB, MB, GB ;-)
	  and timestamps (rather than just byte offsets).
	* oggzdump now interprets theora granulepos as a split of keyframe|pframe
	* oggzdump now also has a --content-type (or -c) option for
	  specifying the name of a particular bitstream to dump
	* r1176: fix some typos in oggzdiff which prevented multiple hide
	  options from being specified
	* r1092: fix a bug in raw seeking, where doing a raw seek by bytes
	  and back again by time (to the original time point) hadn't
	  invalidated the cached time offset, hence the second seek was
	  considered unnecessary and skipped.  This change correctly
	  invalidates the cached time offset when doing a raw byte seek.
	* oggzrip filtering decisions are now made at the start of each logical
	  bitstream, not at every packet. Additionally, the hardcoded limit of
	  extracting no more than 64 logical bitstreams from the input file was removed.
