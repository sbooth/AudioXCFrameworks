FishSound 0.6.2 Release
-----------------------

libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and
encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (Vorbis and Speex).

This release is available as a source tarball at:

http://www.annodex.net/software/libfishsound/download/libfishsound-0.6.2.tar.gz

This release includes improved handling of first and last blocks of data
(bos and eos packets in Ogg):

        * new fish_sound_prepare_truncation() API call
        * improved encdec-audio test to keep track of frames in and out,
          and warn if unequal. (Currently not set to FAIL on this condition
          as it appears to be common for Speex)

It also includes updates to the Win32 nmake build files.

About libfishsound
------------------

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a
lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in
files, they are commonly encapsulated in Ogg to produce Ogg Vorbis
and Speex files.

libfishsound is a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and provides
a consistent, higher-level programming interface. It has been designed for
use in a wide variety of applications; it has no direct dependencies on
Annodex or Ogg encapsulation, though it is most commonly used in conjunction
with liboggz to decode or encode Ogg encapsulated Vorbis or Speex files.

FishSound has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX and
Win32. It probably also works on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files and
Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are all provided in the source distribution.

Full documentation of the FishSound API, customization and installation,
and complete examples of Ogg Vorbis and Speex decoding and encoding are
provided in the source tarball, and can be read online at:
