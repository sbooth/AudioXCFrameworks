About libfishsound
------------------

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a
lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in
files, they are commonly encapsulated in Ogg to produce Ogg FLAC, Speex
and Ogg Vorbis files.

libfishsound is a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and provides
a consistent, higher-level programming interface. It has been designed for
use in a wide variety of applications; it has no direct dependencies on
Ogg encapsulation, though it is most commonly used in conjunction with
liboggz to decode or encode FLAC, Speex or Vorbis audio tracks in Ogg files,
including Ogg Theora and Annodex.

FishSound has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux, Darwin/MacOSX and
Win32. It probably also works on other Unix-like systems via GNU autoconf.
For Win32: nmake Makefiles, Visual Studio .NET 2003 solution files and
Visual C++ 6.0 workspace files are all provided in the source distribution.

Full documentation of the FishSound API, customization and installation,
and complete examples of Ogg FLAC, Speex and Ogg Vorbis decoding and encoding
are provided in the source tarball, and can be read online at:
