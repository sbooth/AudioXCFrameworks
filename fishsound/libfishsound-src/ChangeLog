	* Version 0.9.0

	* Encoding and decoding of the PCM audio and "Vorbiscomment" metadata
	  packets is supported for FLAC streams in Ogg.

	* The documentation and test suite have been updated for FLAC.

	  one track of a multitrack audio file.

	  to ensure that all input samples are correctly encoded without
	  requiring programmer intervention.

	        fish_sound_set_decoded_float;
	        fish_sound_set_decoded_float_ilv;
